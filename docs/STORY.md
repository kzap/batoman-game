# BatoMan — Story & World Bible

## Setting

**Neo-Maynila, 2147.**

The once-chaotic streets of Manila have been transformed into a towering megacity of neon-lit skyscrapers, elevated skyways, and cramped digital slums stacked forty stories high. Jeepneys now hover on magnetic rails. Sari-sari stores sell synthetic food and black-market tech side by side. The Pasig River runs electric blue from bioluminescent algae engineered by the National Science Authority (NSA) — the government body that claims to keep the city safe, but answers to no one.

Beneath the gleaming surface, inequality festers. The wealthy live in sealed arcology towers above the smog line. Everyone else survives in the lower districts — Tondo Sublevel, Divisoria Grid, Quiapo Underground — where power cuts are frequent and NSA enforcement drones patrol day and night.

## The Hero — BatoMan

**Real name:** Andres "Ando" Batumbakal
**Age:** 19
**Origin:** Tondo Sublevel, Neo-Maynila

Ando grew up in the lower districts, the son of a urban farmer who grew vegetables in rooftop community gardens — one of the last remnants of old Manila's provincial spirit. He still wears his father's wide-brimmed **salakot** — the traditional Filipino farmer's hat — as a symbol of where he came from and what he's fighting to protect.

At 16, Ando lost his right arm in an NSA raid that leveled his neighborhood's garden district. A rogue engineer and old friend of his father illegally fitted him with an experimental **plasma buster arm** — a salvaged military-grade prosthetic originally designed as a weapons prototype. The arm looks deceptively ordinary at rest, but its forearm can reconfigure into a **plasma cannon** capable of firing rapid bursts of superheated energy.

With enough focus, Ando can channel additional power into the arm — holding the charge builds pressure until he releases a devastating **Nova Blast**: a wide-spread explosion of plasma that can shatter reinforced steel and overload mechanical systems.

He is not a trained soldier. He is a kid from the slums with a weapon arm, a farmer's hat, and a reason to fight.

### Abilities
- **Plasma Burst** — rapid-fire short-range shots, good for clearing weak enemies
- **Nova Blast** — hold to charge, release for a large area-of-effect plasma explosion; longer charge = bigger blast
- **Salakot Dash** — a sliding low-profile dash using the hat's brim to deflect small projectiles
- **Wall Kick** — can kick off vertical surfaces to reach higher platforms

## The Villain — Dr. Epal

**Full name:** Dr. Edilberto "Eddie" Palaganas
**Title:** Chief Science Director, National Science Authority
**Age:** 58

Dr. Epal — a nickname that stuck because of his talent for inserting himself into situations that don't concern him (*epal* is Filipino slang for someone annoyingly self-important) — was once a legitimate research scientist who genuinely believed technology could uplift the Filipino people.

That idealism curdled decades ago.

Now Dr. Epal operates as both the NSA's top scientist and its most dangerous political operator. He controls the city's infrastructure contracts, the military's weapons budget, and — secretly — a sprawling underground laboratory network beneath Neo-Maynila called **Laboratoryo Zero**. He answers directly to the Oligarch Council that funds the NSA and uses fear as his primary governance tool: when the city's population grows restless, he releases a new mechanical monster into the lower districts to remind everyone they need the NSA's protection.

He doesn't think of himself as evil. He thinks of himself as *necessary*.

### Character Traits
- Brilliant but vindictive — he remembers every slight and repays them decades later
- Obsessed with legacy — wants to be remembered as the man who "modernized" the Philippines
- Publicly charming, privately cruel — beloved in NSA press releases, feared by his own staff
- Views the lower district residents as data points, not people

## The Conflict

Dr. Epal's latest project — **Project ASWANG** — is his most ambitious yet: a series of increasingly powerful mechanical monsters (loosely inspired by Filipino mythological creatures) engineered to terrorize specific districts, drive residents out, and clear land for NSA-owned arcology development.

The first ASWANG unit leveled three blocks of Tondo Sublevel — including the last operating rooftop garden in the district, the one Ando's father had rebuilt after the previous raid.

This time, Ando fights back.

## The Mechanical Monsters (ASWANG Units)

Each boss and enemy class is based on a creature from Filipino mythology, reimagined as a mechanical weapon of urban destruction:

| Unit Name | Mythological Basis | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Manananggal-7** | Manananggal (self-segmenting vampire) | Upper body detaches and flies; lower half guards its power core |
| **Tikbalang-X** | Tikbalang (horse-headed trickster) | Fast quadruped that charges through walls and warps player perception |
| **Kapre-9** | Kapre (giant tree spirit) | Massive slow tank unit that summons smoke screens and hurls debris |
| **Sigbin Unit** | Sigbin (backward-walking shadow creature) | Stealth enemy that attacks from behind; moves erratically |
| **Bakunawa-Prime** | Bakunawa (sea serpent that swallows the moon) | Final boss; enormous mechanical sea serpent that emerges from the Pasig River |

## Tone

BatoMan is **hopeful but grounded**. It doesn't shy away from the real weight of corruption, poverty, and systemic violence — but at its core it's a story about a kid who refuses to give up on his city. There's humor in the Filipino cultural details (the jeepney drivers, the street food vendors who cheer you on, the sari-sari store owner who gives you health pickups). The world is dystopian but not joyless.

Think: *neon-soaked Neo-Manila at night, the smell of street food, bass-heavy OPM music, and a plasma cannon pointed at a robot shaped like your worst nightmare.*
